## 🎯 Objective
To understand and implement different feature scaling techniques that prepare data for machine learning algorithms, ensuring fair weightage to all features and faster model convergence.

---

## 📊 Dataset
A sample dataset is used to illustrate the effects of scaling. The data is loaded and transformed using various scaling methods for comparison.

---

## ⚙️ Techniques Covered
- **Min-Max Scaling (Normalization)**
- **Standardization (Z-score Scaling)**
- **Robust Scaling**
- **MaxAbs Scaling**
- **Comparison of Scaled Features**

Each scaling method is visually compared using plots to show the distribution and transformation effects.
